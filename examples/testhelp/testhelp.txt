To create the boxes, use the IBM extended characters.  Generate
these characters by pressing 'Alt keycode,' for instance: to
generate ป hold down the Alt key and press (on the numeric key
pad) 187, then release the Alt key.

Short cut:
 Notice .topic NoContext=0 and .topic Edit=1100 are the only
 explicit assignments in this help file.  TVHC (Turbo Vision
 Help Compiler) will automatically assign values to all other
 topic contexts.  These values are placed into a XXXX.h file
 which should be placed into your source file.  Thus, future
 changes to the help file will only require recompiling the
 help file and application, and no explicit changes to the
 source code will be necessary.
